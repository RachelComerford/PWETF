    <h1>Positive Work Environment Home Page</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>W3C is a global community where participants choose to work together. In
      that community, we experience differences in language, location,
      nationality,
      and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and
      disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally. </p>
    <p>W3C has developed several resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional
          Conduct (CEPC)</a>, which defines a set of community principles
        regarding how people working in the W3C ecosystem should treat each
        other.</li>
      <li><a href="#Procedures">Procedures</a>, to assist all parties when there
        are issues that arise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also curate a list of <a href="#Education">Education and training</a>
      materials.</p>
    <h2><a name="Procedures" id="Procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These procedures do not substitute for
      intervention by legal authorities. Anyone may seek advice from law
      enforcement
      authorities at any time and should do so immediately if a situation is
      dangerous or potentially so.</p>
    <p>Timely action is encouraged, especially if a behavior rises to the level
      of
      <a href="/Consortium/cepc/#Harassment">harassment</a> or intimidation.</p>
    <div class="alert">
      If one person believes another's behavior is inappropriate (inconsistent
      with
      <a href="/Consortium/cepc/">CEPC</a>), and ordinary communication between
      them is not possible, escalation of the issue takes place by contacting
      one of the <a href="#ombuds">W3C Ombuds</a>, which may be done
      confidentially.</div>
    <p>Any individual in the W3C community —including staff, members, invited
      experts, participants in W3C meetings, in W3C teleconferences, and
      participants in mailing lists— may call upon the W3C ombuds for assistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In exceptional circumstances, the W3C Director
      may ban an individual from participating in our activities, e.g. on a
      mailing
      list or in a group (refer to <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies.html#member-rep">section
        3.1.2 of the W3C
        Process Document</a>). </p>
    <h3><a name="ombuds" id="ombuds">Ombuds</a></h3>
    <p>The W3C Ombuds are a small group selected by the W3C management to act as
      trusted confidants to work toward resolving complaints between any
      internal or external constituent. Ombuds will operate by procedures appropriate to
      their sites and jurisdictions. </p>
    <p>The ombuds positions are currently held by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The W3C CEO, </li>
      <li>one person for each W3C Host</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: there is no obligation to contact an Ombuds associated with a
      particular W3C Host, but they may be able to orient complaints to the
      right
      process and next steps more quickly.</p>
    <h3><a id="Current" name="Current">Ombuds list</a></h3>
    <p>The ombuds may be contacted individually or in subset (potentially all of
      them).</p>

    <h2><a name="Ombuddy's Standards of Practice">Ombuddy's Standards of Practice</a></h2>
	<p>Ombuddy's Standards of Practice are constructed based on the International Ombudsman Association's (IOA) Best Practices and Standards of Practice documentation. They have been adjusted to fit the needs and structure of the W3C groups and activities.</p>
	  <ol> 
		  <li>The Ombuddy exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regarding an individual’s concern, a trend or concerns of multiple individuals over time. The Ombuddy may also initiate action on a concern identified through the Ombuddy’s direct observation.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy is neutral, impartial, and unaligned.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy strives for impartiality, fairness and objectivity in the treatment of people and the consideration of issues. The Ombuddy advocates for fair and equitably administered processes and does not advocate on behalf of any individual within the organization.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy is a designated neutral reporting to the highest possible level of the organization and operating independently of ordinary line and staff structures. The Ombuddy should not report to nor be structurally affiliated with any compliance function of the organization.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy serves in no additional role within the organization which would compromise the ombuddy’s neutrality. The Ombuddy should not be aligned with any formal or informal associations within the organization in a way that might create actual or perceived conflicts of interest for The Ombuddy. The Ombuddy should have no personal interest or stake in, and incur no gain or loss from, the outcome of an issue.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy has a responsibility to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under consideration.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy helps develop a range of responsible options to resolve problems and facilitate discussion to identify the best options.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy holds all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence and takes all reasonable steps to safeguard confidentiality, including the following:
The Ombuddy does not reveal, and must not be required to reveal, the identity of any individual contacting The Ombuddy Office, nor does The Ombuddy reveal information provided in confidence that could lead to the identification of any individual contacting The Ombuddy Office, without that individual’s express permission, given in the course of informal discussions with The Ombuddy; The Ombuddy takes specific action related to an individual’s issue only with the individual’s express permission and only to the extent permitted, and even then at the sole discretion of The Ombuddy, unless such action can be taken in a way that safeguards the identity of the individual contacting The Ombuddy Office. The only exception to this privilege of confidentiality is where there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm, and where there is no other reasonable option. Whether this risk exists is a determination to be made by The Ombuddy.</li>
		  <li>Communications between the Ombuddy and others (made while the Ombuddy is serving in that capacity) are considered privileged. The privilege belongs to the Ombuddy and the Ombuddy Office, rather than to any party to an issue. Others cannot waive this privilege. </li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy does not testify in any formal process inside the organization and resists testifying in any formal process outside of the organization regarding a visitor’s contact with or confidential information communicated to the Ombuddy, even if given permission or requested to do so. The Ombuddy may, however, provide general, non-confidential information about the Ombuddy Office or the Ombuddy profession.</li>
		  <li>If the Ombuddy pursues an issue systemically (e.g., provides feedback on trends, issues, policies and practices) the Ombuddy does so in a way that safeguards the identity of individuals.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy keeps no records containing identifying information on behalf of the organization.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy maintains information (e.g., notes, phone messages, appointment calendars) in a secure location and manner, protected from inspection by others (including management), and has a consistent and standard practice for the destruction of such information.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy prepares any data and/or reports in a manner that protects confidentiality.</li>
		  <li>Communications made to the Ombuddy are not notice to the organization. The Ombuddy neither acts as agent for, nor accepts notice on behalf of, the organization and shall not serve in a position or role that is designated by the organization as a place to receive notice on behalf of the organization. However, the Ombuddy may refer individuals to the appropriate place where formal notice can be made.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy functions on an informal basis by such means as: listening, providing and receiving information, identifying and reframing issues, developing a range of responsible options, and – with permission and at Ombudsman discretion – engaging in informal third-party intervention. When possible, the Ombuddy helps people develop new ways to solve problems themselves.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy as an informal and off-the-record resource pursues resolution of concerns and looks into procedural irregularities and/or broader systemic problems when appropriate.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy does not make binding decisions, mandate policies, or formally adjudicate issues for the organization.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy supplements, but does not replace, any formal channels. Use of the Ombuddy Office is voluntary, and is not a required step in any grievance process or organizational policy.</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy does not participate in any formal investigative or adjudicative procedures. Formal investigations should be conducted by others. When a formal investigation is requested, the Ombuddy refers individuals to the appropriate offices or individual</li>
		  <li>The Ombuddy identifies trends, issues and concerns about policies and procedures, including potential future issues and concerns, without breaching confidentiality or anonymity, and provides recommendations for responsibly addressing them.</li>
